    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg wheat flour</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoon Margarine</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Cups warm water</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix flour, sugar and salt. Add Margarine, mix with hands to form crumbs. You can add a little bit of sugar to bring a savoury taste</li>
        <li>Pour water bit by bit as you knead. Knead at least at least 5 minutes until the dough is soft to cook very soft chapatis</li>
        <li>Finally dough should be firm but soft and not sticky. Cover with a damp cloth/cling film/plastic polythene bag for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>After 30 minutes, knead again and cut into balls</li>
        <li>Roll out the balls in a circular shape with a rolling pin, and brush with oil</li>
        <li>Roll the balls out again forming a circle</li>
        <li>In a medium heat, place your skillet. Let it warm up. Then put your chapati on top. Fry both sides until brown. Once cooked remove and place it in a container and cover</li>
        <li>Serve with your favourite stew or even tea. Enjoy</li>
